      "ReviewText": "I've been using it consistently this season over my brown  jacket and this thing is ill.I bought the Geiger in White and I couldn't be more pleased.The inside is nice and silky with the goose down on the inside to keep you warm.The outside looks fresh with a vibrant white with silver logos.\n\nI get compliments on this jacket all the time because of how much it stands out in the crowd.The hood fits perfect over my dragon goggles sitting on top of my head when its not dumping snow.All around this jacket is perfect.",
