# 6.13.0

## Conversations

### New Authentication Interfaces

Added a new `AuthenticationProvider` interface that should be implemented, and provided to each submission
request. e.g.

```kotlin
val submitReq = ReviewSubmissionReq.Builder(Action.Submit, "testProd")
  .authenticationProvider(authProvider)
  .build()
client.prepareCall(submitReq).loadAsync({
  (resp) -> {
    // all good, change Action to Submit to actually send   
  },
  (convSubmitException) -> {
    val bvErrors = convSubmitException.getErrors()
    val bvFieldErrors = convSubmitException.getFieldErrors()
    for (fieldError in bvFieldErrors) {
      val submissionErrorCode = fieldError.getSubmissionErrorCode()
      val relevantFormField = fieldError.getFormField() // gets the form field info
    }
  }
})
```

* If you are configured for BV Hosted Authentication then you should use `BVHostedAuthenticationProvider`.
* If you are configured for Site Authentication then you should use `SiteAuthenticationProvider`.

For more info on how to use/create these providers, and how to check which one you are configured for,
refer to the `Conversations > Content Submission` page in the docs.  


# 6.12.0

## Conversations

### New success/failure routing, and new Action type

#### Guide

Previously fetching form data and parsing form errors was difficult. Not all paths of `Action` routed to the same callback, and most error paths did not have the required data to parse programmatically. All of the previous APIs for doing these things remains in the 6.x SDK for now, but has been marked as deprecated in favor of these new APIs.

##### Get Form Data

```kotlin
val submitReq = ReviewSubmissionReq.Builder(Action.Form, "testProd") // NEW ACTION TYPE
  .build()
client.prepareCall(submitReq).loadAsync({
  (resp) -> {
    val hasErrors = resp.getHasErrors() // not required to check anymore, always false in success
    val formFields = resp.getFormFields() // null-safe list of available form options
    for (formField in formFields) {
      val isRequired = formField.isRequired()  // indicates you must send this field
    }      
  },
  (convSubmitException) -> {
    val bvErrors = convSubmitException.getErrors() // null-safe list of generic errors
    val bvFormErrors = convSubmitException.getFieldErrors() // null-safe list of form errors
  }
})
```

##### Test Submission

```kotlin
val submitReq = ReviewSubmissionReq.Builder(Action.Preview, "testProd")
  .build()
client.prepareCall(submitReq).loadAsync({
  (resp) -> {
    // all good, change Action to Submit to actually send   
  },
  (convSubmitException) -> {
    val bvErrors = convSubmitException.getErrors()
    val bvFieldErrors = convSubmitException.getFieldErrors()
    for (fieldError in bvFieldErrors) {
      val submissionErrorCode = fieldError.getSubmissionErrorCode()
      val relevantFormField = fieldError.getFormField() // gets the form field info
    }
  }
})
```

##### Submit

Same as Test Submission, except use `Action.Submit` and it actually sends.

#### Details
* Added `Action.Form` for submission to route to success without required form fields. `Action.Preview` and `Action.Submit` will always route to failure if all required form fields are not provided
* Added `ConversationsDisplayCallback`
* Added `ConversationsSubmissionCallback`
* Added `ConversationsException` which has `#getErrors()`
* Added `ConversationsSubmissionException` which has `#getFieldErrors()`
* Added `LoadCallDisplay#loadDisplaySync()`
* Deprecated `LoadCallDisplay#loadSync()` in favor of `LoadCallDisplay#loadDisplaySync()`
* Added `LoadCallDisplay#loadAsync(conversationsDisplayCallback)`
* Deprecated `LoadCallDisplay#loadAsync(conversationsCallback)` in favor of `LoadCallDisplay#loadAsync(conversationsDisplayCallback)`
* Added `LoadCallSubmission#loadSubmissionSync()`
* Deprecated `LoadCallSubmission#loadSync()` in favor of `LoadCallSubmission#loadSubmissionSync()`
* Added `LoadCallSubmission#loadAsync(conversationsSubmissionCallback)`
* Deprecated `LoadCallSubmission#loadAsync(conversationsCallback)` in favor of `LoadCallSubmission#loadAsync(conversationsSubmissionCallback)`

### Other Stuff
* Update `BazaarRuntimeException` to not cause StackOverflowException
* Update JSON parse failure message
* Update `BVErrors` exist message
* Added `BVConversationsClientTest` to test all routes
* Updated Robolectric version for testing

# 6.11.0

## Conversations

* Added `SubmissionErrorCode` enum to parse the code strings from the `FieldErrors` JSON field for submission
* Added `FieldError#getErrorCode()` method for getting the enum
* Added unit tests for invalid field error code parsing, valid field error code parsing, and generic field error
list parsing

# 6.10.0

## Conversations
* Add `Author#getSecondaryRatingList()`
* Add `BaseReview#getSecondaryRatingList()`
* Add `IncludeContentBase#getBadgeList()`
* Add `IncludeContentBase#getContextDataValueList()`
* Fix `BaseReviewBuilder#addContextDataValueString(String dataValueName, boolean value)` to be
named `BaseReviewBuilder#addContextDataValueBoolean(String dataValueName, boolean value)`
* Remove empty `ReviewSubmissionRequest#newBuilder()` method
* Add `ConversationsSubmissionRequest.Builder#addCustomSubmissionParameter(String key, String value)`
* Add internal FormPair class to store user custom form parameters
* Add `ConversationsDisplayRequest.Builder#ConversationsDisplayRequest.Builder#addCustomDisplayParameter(String key, String value)`
* Deprecated `ConversationsDisplayRequest.Builder#addAdditionalField(String key, String value)`

* Added `FormInputType` enum to introduce a strongly typed version of `String type = FormField#getType()`.
The possible values were taken from [the conversations docs on input types](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/conversations-api/tutorials/submission/input-types). This will allow for easier parsing of which form fields have many options. e.g.

```java
final FormInputType formInputType = formField.getFormInputType();
switch(formInputType) {
  case FormInputType.SELECT: {
    List<FormFieldOption> options = formField.getFormFieldOptions();
    // present options to user
    break;
  }
}
```

for Conversations.
* Deprecated the default ```BVConversationsClient``` constructor.
* Add multiple value support to review display filtering

for BVPixel.

knowing when your shoppers are entering and exiting your physical retail locations. You will be

you have a simple greeting or coupon? Aside from the value you add within your mobile experience,
Bazaarvoice can use this location context to enhance our existing products. Rating and Reviews
filtered down to the city level, recommended products for nearby people like you, local social media
content (Curations), and more are all possible by using the Location module.

### Conversations Revamped

This NEXUS_USER provides a vast improvement over the current display and submission API for Conversations.
The following improvements will:

* decrease implementation time
* provide deserialized responses returned in P.O.J.O (plain old java objects), as opposed to returning
a raw json response string
* make error handling much simpler, (e.g. wrapping legacy conversations API implementation details so
you don't have to worry about it
* provide View container objects, which makes ROI reporting much simpler

We have deprecated the ```BazaarRequest``` class as well as any related classes to implement
Conversation the old way. For any clients migrating from the ```BazaarRequest``` API, please refer to
the upgrade guide: https://bazaarvoice.github.io/bv-android-sdk/upgrading_conversations.html
