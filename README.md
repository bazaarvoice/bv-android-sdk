# BVAndroidSDK Documentation
BVAndroidSDK docs are hosted here via [Github pages](https://pages.github.com).  
Docs are built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).  

### Development
Install Jekyll with:  
```bash
gem install jekyll
```
And build/serve with:
```bash
jekyll serve  
# go to localhost:4000
```  

Jekyll puts the generated page in the `_site/` directory. This should be put into `gh-pages` branch as top-level documents, so that `index.html` is reachable.
