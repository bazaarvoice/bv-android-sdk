# Bazaarvoice Android SDK
### *Version: 2.0.3

## Introduction
The Bazaarvoice software development kit (SDK) for Android is an Android static library that provides an easy way to generate REST calls to the Bazaarvoice Developer API. Using this SDK, mobile developers can quickly integrate Bazaarvoice content into their native Android apps for phones and tablets on API Level 3 and above.

Developers can display content as well as submit content such as Ratings & Reviews, Ask & Answer and Stories, including text and photo. Included reference apps and a Quick Start Guide will allow developers to integrate Bazaarvoice quickly, with little overhead.


**Where To Start:**

1.  Read the Quick Start guide to get familiar with installation and building a bare-bones, simple application that uses the SDK.
2.  The documentation, located in the docs folder, provides additional information into the capabilities of the SDK itself.
3.  Sample applications, located in the apps folder, provide example uses of the SDK and implementation best practices.
