A vet may make about $30 on a package of Heartgard every six months per client but will make substantially more with a regular client.

We write them just to keep clients happy (even though our stuff can be less expensive than certain items on this site, I've never really understood that). Prescriptions are also given out in case of problems with our stock. We have one dog who is simply too old and picky to use Iverhart. Since we don't carry Heartgard, we happily give out prescriptions for it to keep that dog healthy. We have a happy client as well who is more than likely going to stay with us.",

They even sent our pup a milk bone which was so sweet!!! I just thought that was awesome! Poor girl didn't get to eat it because she's allergic, but our foster pup enjoyed it! Thank you for making it so simple to receive our mess!",
