IntentExample
====================

When you install this app, a service is registered with the device to enable sharing through Bazaarvoice from any context. You can then take a photo with the camera, choose your photo in the gallery, click share, and choose BV Photo Share. You will then be brought to a screen where you can add a caption and a story to your photo. The API key that is used to make this reference app has not been specially configured, so it requires a full story submission for your photo, but the configuration can be changed to allow anonymous submission.
